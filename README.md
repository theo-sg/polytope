# polytope
POLYTOPE is a 2D action adventure puzzle platformer game that mixes interesting mechanics with a darkly humorous storyline.

# origins
I began working on the prototype of this game around February 2020, and now I am working on the final project as of January 2021. I intend to eventually release this game as a fully functioning product!
